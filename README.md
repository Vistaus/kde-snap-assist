# kde-snap-assist
This KWin script for KDE Plasma suggests other window thumbnails on snap. It tries to replicate famous Windows 10/11 feature called "snap assist".
Assist can be shown by dragging a window to the screen edge, as well as via default keyboard shortcuts (Super + arrows).

Current limitations:
- Script does not support quater tiling, only side-to-side tiling 
- To apply new settings, you may need to re-enable the script

This is my first KWin script, so bugs reports and contributions are welcome!
